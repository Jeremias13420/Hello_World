# Hello_World
I am a student web developer. I have absolutely zero experience with coding and web development. Although that may be the case, I am very eager to learn how to code and develop web applications. I took a class that was about HTML 5 and CSS 3, but to be honest I didn't get much out of it. So that was a little disappointing.
